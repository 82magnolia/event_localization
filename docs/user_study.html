                <p class="text-justify">
                    Modern AR/VR applications frequently request the client to take photos & videos of their surroundings for immersive experiences rendered on top of the everyday world. This means that once AR/VR services become ubiquitous, people can be unknowingly captured and their visual data can be stored on servers of AR/VR service providers.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    In this questionnaire we aim to examine how people feel about being captured with cameras of complete strangers, and having the visual information stored on data centers of AR/VR services.

                    On a scale of 1 to 5, please rate the feeling of insecurity for being captured with a camera in the following scenarios. 1 means that you are completely okay with the visual information being captured, 5 means that you are seriously concerned.
                    <ol>
                        <li>You are captured on CCTV. A small group of people (security guards, administrators, etc.) may regularly view the recorded content.</li>

                    Event cameras are neuromorphic sensors that encode visual information as a sequence of events. In contrast to conventional frame-based cameras that output absolute brightness intensities, event cameras respond to brightness changes. The following figure shows a visual description of how event cameras function compared to conventional cameras. Notice how brightness changes are encoded as 'streams' in the spatio-temporal domain.

                    Recent advances in deep learning enable recovering images from event camera data. Here is a side-by-side visualization of events and frames reconstructed solely using event camera data. Note that while the reconstruction is quite noisy, it is nevertheless possible to recover the original visual content only using events.
